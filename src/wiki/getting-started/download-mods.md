# Downloading Mods

Make sure you know how to [Create an Instance](../create-instance) before attempting to download mods.

Inside the **Edit Instance** menu, select the **version** tab on the left sidebar. From here, you will need to decide on which mod loader you would like to use. **Fabric** and **Forge** are the most popular, with Forge having the most mods available. Fabric and Forge mods are generally not cross-compatible, so choosing between them will change your selection of mods.

Once you have picked out your ideal mod loader, go to the **Mods** tab, and select the **Download Mods** option that's to the right. From here, you can choose to install from both *Modrinth* and *CurseForge* services. Modrinth focuses more towards free and open-source mods, however, CurseForge has a much larger selection.

It is worth noting that many mods will be available on **both platforms**.

After you've chosen your mod provider, you can search or browse for any desired mods. Click the **Select mod for download** button to add each mod to your download queue. Once finished, you can now press **OK**, and your mods should begin downloading.

If you have elected to use the **Fabric** mod loader, then please ensure that the latest version of the **Fabric API** mod available for your game version is installed. It is mostly **required** for Fabric mods.

If it is missing, you can find it by right-clicking on your instance in Prism Launcher and selecting the **Edit Instance** option in the menu.
