### Java Wizard

![Java wizard page displayed on the first launch](/img/screenshots/JavaWizardDark.png)

In this page you can set the global Java settings.

For more information on how to manually download and install java check the documentation [found here](../getting-started/installing-java).

For more information about each java setting check the documentation [found here](Java-settings).

We recommend that new users enable both the Autodetect and Auto-download Java features, in order not to need to manually set up their java path for each instance.
