Hello!

This is a very minor update - we had reports of unexpected reboots when installing the launcher on Windows; this release should patch it!

Apologies for the delay - we were not initially quite aware of the impact that this had as Windows *should* warn users if they have any unsaved work.

# Changelog

## Fixed

- Fix Windows installer restarting device by [@TheKodeToad](https://github.com/TheKodeToad) in [#2948](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/pull/2948)

Full Changelog: <https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/compare/9.0...9.1>
