Java memory settings.
NOTE: MORE RAM ALLOCATED DOESN'T MEAN BETTER PERFORMANCE! In fact, in most use cases (except you're playing big modpacks) 4GB of ram allocated should be more than enough

## Java Runtime

This is where the settings for the Java runtime live, like the location of the runtime and any Java arguments to use.

For information about how to get a correct Java version, see: [Installing Java](../../getting-started/installing-java).

**Auto-detect** will check your computer for all java versions and show you a list of them, the best one on top.

**Test** can be used to test the selected Java runtime along with your memory settings and JVM arguments without starting the game.

**Skip java compatibility checks** skips java compatibility checks at game launch
