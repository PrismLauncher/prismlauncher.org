## Why this

Once opon a time, OF was the best way to make your game better. Things changed.

## Sodium

Sodium is the best client side optimization mod at the moment and it's highly raccomended.

To install in PolyMC, create a fabric instance, then go to the mods tab and click "Download Mods". There, click on Sodium, click mod for download and then Ok

## Iris

Iris allows you to run OF Shaders while using Sodium. It works great, but it doesn't support every shaderpack at the moment.

Click [here](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/blob/trunk/docs/supportedshaders.md) for a list of currently supported shaderpacks

To install in PolyMC, create a fabric instance, then go to the mods tab and click "Download Mods". There, click on Iris, click mod for download and then Ok

## Other Mods

If you want to improve your performance, consider installing lithium and starlight

I can't list every mod here, you can find a big list of optifine alternatives [here](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/)

# Fabulously Optimized

If you don't want to search and install these mods manually, the [Fabulously Optimized](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized) modpack is for you!

See the MultiMC/MultiMC (auto-update) guide to install it, they work on PolyMC too.
