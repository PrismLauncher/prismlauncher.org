### Theme

### Randomcat and Gifcat

Prism Launcher includes two optional built-in cat styles called randomcat and gifcat, which can be selected in the same menu as the Background Cat option.

- randomcat displays a random static cat image  
- gifcat displays a random animated cat GIF  

These features are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay. They are available without installing external CatPacks and can be selected from:

Settings → User Interface → Theme → Background Cat
