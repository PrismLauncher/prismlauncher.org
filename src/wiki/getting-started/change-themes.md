    - on **Linux:** `~/.local/share/PrismLauncher/themes`

- Unzip the newly downloaded theme in the `themes` folder.

- Restart Prism Launcher, then open the global settings. In the Launcher section, click the User Interface tab, and under Widgets (make sure you're changing Widgets and not Icons), choose the newly added theme. Click the Close button, and enjoy your fresh new Prism Launcher.

  - In this newly created folder add files named `README.md`, `theme.json`, `themeStyle.css` and `theme.json.license`.

    - In `theme.json.license` add the text below, and replace `"Year"` with the current year, replace `"Theme Owner"` with the theme creator nickname, `"License name"` with the license of your theme.

    ```text
    SPDX-FileCopyrightText: "Year" "Theme owner"

    SPDX-License-Identifier: "License SPDX Identifier"
    ```

    - (Note: `theme.json` and `themeStyle.css` are the files that contain your theme.)

    - Format your `README.md` just like this [Template Readme](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/Themes/blob/main/README-Template.md) and replace every text between a `"` like `"This"` with their respective use.

  - Add a screenshot of your theme and rename it to `preview.png`.

    - Then create a file named `preview.png.license` and add the text below, and replace `"Year"` and `Screenshot owner"` with their respective use.

    ```text
    SPDX-FileCopyrightText: "Year" "Screenshot owner"

    SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0
    ```

- Verify that you did everything correctly, if you did please proceed to the next and last step.
