After an entire hour of hard work, the Prism Launcher team is thrilled to announce our new program: **Prism Premium!** This brings a new way to support the project, and give _you_ an even better Prism Launcher experience.

## What is it?

Prism Premium is an exciting new feature we're introducing in the upcoming Prism ùïè (10.0), meant to help our community explore new opportunities with our launcher and how they play the game. We plan on constantly expanding this, with more and more features, cosmetics, and events being pushed out to the launcher on a regular basis. It will be all front and center going forward!

## How does it work?

We currently offer year-round benefits such as in-game cosmetics, access to more launcher features, and exclusive perks in our Discord server. Be on the look out for seasonable promotions as well!
