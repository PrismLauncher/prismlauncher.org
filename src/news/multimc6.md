Today, I am happy to announce MultiMC 6, a new, reimagined version of MultiMC written in the **best language ever**, Haskell. MultiMC 6 will be far more stable and faster than MultiMC 5, and will make your Minecraft launching experience much more enjoyable. Furthermore, we've decided that MultiMC's scope shouldn't be limited to simply launching Minecraft. That's why we'll be adding support for several more games to MultiMC, such as:

- Factorio
- Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas
- Skyrim
- Kerbal Space Program
- And much more!

In addition, we will be providing a plugin interface which will allow third party developers to write plugins for launching other games as well. We'll be sure to make the plugin API full of crazy monads and cryptic functions that don't quite make sense. We know that's what Haskell developers truly enjoy.

Unfortunately, we'll have to make some changes as well. Due to the lack of Windows users, we'll be dropping support for Windows in MultiMC 6 and focusing on Linux, OS X, and [Haiku OS](https://www.haiku-os.org/) for further developments. Honestly, it doesn't really matter too much, since nobody really uses Windows.

That's all there is to say for now. Work on MultiMC 5 will be dropped tomorrow, and we'll begin development on MultiMC 6 immediately. Expect an early alpha build that doesn't quite work some time in late 2016.

Thanks for using MultiMC. If you have any questions, you may [contact me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Forkk13).

P.S. - Happy April Fools' Day!
