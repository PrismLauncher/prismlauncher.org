This page reflects the contents of the instance's mods folder and is used for certain forge mod loader versions. This is only applicable to minecraft versions that are before 1.13 . Unlike an ordinary file explorer, it also shows details about the mods like version and name.

You can drag and drop more mods into the view, just like any other folder. The mods also have a checkbox next to them, which allows you to temporarily disable them.

Clicking "Download Mods" you can download mods from Modrinth and CurseForge.
