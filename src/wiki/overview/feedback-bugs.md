# Feedback and Bugs

We really appreciate all kinds of feedback from our community. If you've ran into a bug while using PolyMC, or if you'd like to suggest our next killer feature, please head over to our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/issues) page and make a post.

**NOTE:** If you're reporting a bug, please do have a good look through the list of issues posted by other users. It may have already been reported by someone else, or better yet, fixed!

Once you're done there, why don't you come and [join us](https://polymc.org/#get-involved) on our Discord server, Matrix Space, or subreddit? ~~*Or how about all three?*~~
