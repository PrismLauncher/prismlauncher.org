# Development Builds

Please understand that **these builds are not intended for most users**. There may be bugs, and other instabilities. You have been warned.

There are per-commit development builds [available here](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/actions). Debug information is present within the binaries, making their file sizes larger than otherwise normal.
If you don't have a GitHub account, you can [download them using nightly.link](https://nightly.link/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/workflows/build/develop).

Non-portable binaries are currently available for Windows as a system install, macOS .app, Linux tarball, and AppImage.

Portable dev-builds are also provided; for both Windows and Linux.

For **Arch**, **Debian/Ubuntu**, **Fedora**, **OpenSUSE**, **Gentoo** and **Windows**, respectively, you can use these packages for the latest development versions:
