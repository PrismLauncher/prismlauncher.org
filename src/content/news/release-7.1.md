Hello!

This is a smaller release, with mostly bug fixes. There are also some minor improvements, like an easier way to open the launcher's data directory, and allowing users to edit instance settings even while an instance is running.

There is also an important fix for the .mrpack export on Windows. Previously, the launcher would bundle all mods into the final modpack ZIP. Now the launcher will correctly bundle the metadata instead. This bug caused trouble at Modrinth as people started uploading these modpacks there. We are very sorry for this bug and hope to catch these kinds of issues through our testing initiative on our Discord server.

Until next time!
