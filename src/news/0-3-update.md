We're happy to announce a new version with a bunch of new features and bugfixes - MultiMC 5 Version 0.3!

Some of the changes include:

* An improved instance view,
* Overhauled 1.6+ loading,
* New patch based system for modifying instances,
* Better offline mode,
* Improved clarity in some of the dialogs (for example, it's clear when there are no Forge versions available),
* Tooling support (including JProfiler, JVisualVM and MCEdit),
* Screenshot management and uploading,
* Fixed encoding of escape sequences (eg \t \n) in config files,
* Miscellaneous bugfixes,
* Full changelog available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/blob/develop/changelog.yaml).
