It’s that time of the year again: happy pride month! And we hope it’s a great one :)

We’re proud to have such an amazing and queer community, who support us year-round through contributions, sending “meows” in our Discord server, creating guides and walkthroughs, in-game content we can all enjoy, and just using the launcher we’ve built. You’re all the best, and we wouldn’t be here without you. We hope to keep providing you with the same fun space we always have

During this time, we also think it’s important to highlight some resources out there to help you or those close to you\*:

- [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/get-help/) hosts a 24/7/365 crisis hotline for LGBTQ+ youth
- The [Transgender Law Center](https://transgenderlawcenter.org/resources/) has educational resources for common challenges and questions transgender people may face
- [InReach](https://inreach.org/) is an open source platform that helps LGTBQ+ people discover verified resources to assist them in their situations, with a focus on helping refugees, BIPOC, transgender people, and the youth.

<sub><sup>\*</sup> Please review the applicable Terms of Service for each resource. Mandatory reporting laws or policies may apply</sub>

There are also many organizations that could use your help directly. Some of our favorites include:

- [GLAAD](https://glaad.org/): a non-profit advocating for cultural change and LGTBQ acceptance through more inclusive media
- The [Marsha P Johnson Institute](https://marshap.org): a project meant to help protect the human rights of Black trans people through organization, advocacy, education, strengthening community, and promoting collective power
- [SAGE](https://www.sageusa.org/): a national advocacy and services organization that assists elderly queer people in housing, education, and wellness
- [ILGA Europe](https://www.ilga-europe.org/): a collective of over 700 member organizations that advocates for the freedom, rights, health, and safety of LGTBQ+ people across Europe
- The [Matthew Shepard Foundation](https://www.matthewshepard.org/): founded in memory of a 21-year old student who was a victim of anti-gay hate crime, they work to continue Matthew’s legacy by sharing his story, love for others, and help prevent the past from repeating itself
- [CSD Berlin](https://csd-berlin.de/en): one of the largest pride festivals in Europe, which also supports queer refugees through counseling and medical services
- \<Your local organizations here\>: supporting your local charities, collectives, etc. helps make change right in your own neighborhood

To celebrate the ever-amazing creativity of our queer community, we will also be doing something new:

## A community showcase!

For each week this month, our staff will be compiling and showcasing queer-created content from across the Minecraft community. This includes:

- Mods
- Resource packs
- Shader packs
- [CatPacks](/wiki/getting-started/catpacks/)
- …and probably whatever else you think is cool and Minecraft/Prism Launcher related

You can send us suggestions in the [Pride 2025 Showcase thread](https://discord.com/channels/1031648380885147709/1379576393234649128) on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ArX2nafFz2), or shoot us an email at [`contact@prismlauncher.org`](mailto:contact@prismlauncher.org) (Try to avoid raw files please! We suggest linking to projects on Modrinth, CurseForge, and GitHub)

Happy pride, and remember: you matter, you are valid, and you are loved.
Talk to you again soon!
