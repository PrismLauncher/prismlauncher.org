          Install and launch modpacks easily, while keeping them clean.
          No longer do you need to manually install them, and easily update modpacks, Prism Launcher can do these tasks for you, without installing tons of separate launchers.

          Are you tired of manually switching mods for different versions, installing modloaders?<p>
          <p>Prism Launcher can help. Each Minecraft instance has its own folder, with separate mods, resource packs and other things.</p>

          You don't need an embedded web browser as a game launcher. Prism Launcher uses the Qt toolkit, which requires little system resources. Prism Launcher also lets you customize the menu and supports <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/change-themes/">custom themes</a>.
