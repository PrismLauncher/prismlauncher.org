Hi there!

We are bringing you Prism Launcher 5.1!
This is our first patch release after the _thing_.
While we promised to bring you a blog article about the _thing_, it seems like interest has died down and there are many good write-ups/explanations of the situation on the internet.
We did update [our FAQ](../../wiki/overview/faq) though, so feel free to read that.

Now to the update.
This mainly consists of bug fixes, nothing too exciting.
Other than that Windows users might like our new 64-bit builds.
We are already hyped for our next feature release though, which will bring some UI improvements.
