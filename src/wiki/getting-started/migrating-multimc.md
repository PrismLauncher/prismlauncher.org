# Migrating instances from MultiMC

## <img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5411890" height="20" />  In MultiMC

In order to transfer an instance, or multiple instances from MultiMC to PolyMC, you must begin the process by opening MultiMC on your computer.

Now that MultiMC is open, navigate to the **Folders** tab located on the top menu bar, to the left of the Settings tab.

Left click on the tab and select the **View Instance Folder** option. This should then open your system's file explorer application with the correct directory in view.

Now that the MultiMC instance directory is open, you may **select**, and then **copy** the instances that you wish to transfer.

To complete the transfer process, you must now open PolyMC.

As you did in MultiMC previously, navigate to the **Folders** tab located on the top menu bar, to the left of the Settings tab.

Left click on the tab and select the **View Instance Folder** option. This should once again open your system's file explorer application with the correct directory in view.

Now that the PolyMC instance directory is open, you may **paste** the instance(s) that you previously copied from the MultiMC directory.

*Optional: If you would like to transfer your pack icon selections, navigate up from the MultiMC instances folder to the main MultiMC folder. Do the same for PolyMC. Copy the* **icons** *folder from MultiMC to PolyMC.*

## Finishing up

Now, in **PolyMC**, your instances should appear as they normally would in MultiMC.

If you have transfered instances across devices or packaging formats, you may need to change the version of **Java** that'll be used to launch Minecraft. You can learn how to do so on [this page](../installing-java).
