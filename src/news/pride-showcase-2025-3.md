At long last, we're [back](https://prismlauncher.org/news/pride-showcase-2025-2/) for Week 3! This one is a bit special, with today marking the 56th anniversary of the [Stonewall Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots) of 1969. These demonstrations helped pave the way for Queer rights in the United States and across the globe. It's important to look back on these events to see how far we've come, how we can make things better, and remember the people who have been monumental in getting us to where we are today. We hope you join us and many others today in celebration with our community, and encourage giving back to organizations like the [Marsha P. Johnson Institute](https://marshap.org/) that help continue the fight for Queer liberation.

As a reminder, you can also send in your own submissions through the [Pride 2025 Showcase thread](https://discord.com/channels/1031648380885147709/1379576393234649128) on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ArX2nafFz2), or email us at [`contact@prismlauncher.org`](mailto:contact@prismlauncher.org). Thanks again to all who have already joined in â€” and don't worry if yours haven't been included yet! We hope to get to all of them :)

[Everybody Loves: Bees](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/everybody-loves-bees) is a resource pack that turns the bees gay, [again!](https://tenor.com/view/alex-jones-gay-frogs-gif-10685294). This time though, each bee actually carries around a nice little pride flag that flows in the wind as they fly around. You can even use it with the bees from other resource packs for a pretty unique look.

[Reactive Alchemy](https://modrinth.com/mod/reactive) is a magic mod based around alchemy and in-world experimentation. It features a complex system of elemental powers, transmutation, arcane-powered weapons, flying boats, teleporting cows, and all of it is documented in a guidebook! It also has one of the coolest mod trailers we've seen, along with great art.
