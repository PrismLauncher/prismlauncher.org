Heya folks,
The Prism Launcher Team will no longer post on the platform formerly known as Twitter. Twitter does not align with our values and hasn't in a long time. In good conscience, we can not support a platform controlled by those spreading hate.
We believe in fostering an accepting and helpful community, and Twitter is no longer the place for that. We encourage y'all to follow us on alternative platforms such as [Mastodon/Fediverse](https://floss.social/@PrismLauncher) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/prismlauncher.org).

### Going Forward

We will be delisting Twitter from our pages, and parking our handle to prevent takeovers.
No more content will actively be posted on our Twitter.
