After a short delay (and as we announced in our [previous blogpost](/news/pride-month-2025)), here's our first showcase of the month! These are all amazing mods made by our queer community, that we had a blast playing with.

As a reminder, you can also send your own submissions in the [Pride 2025 Showcase thread](https://discord.com/channels/1031648380885147709/1379576393234649128) on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ArX2nafFz2), or email us at [`contact@prismlauncher.org`](mailto:contact@prismlauncher.org). Thanks to all of those who have already joined in, and don't worry if yours haven't been included yet! We hope to get to all of them :)

## Pridepack

[Pridepack](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pridepack) is a resource pack that adds a ton of LGTBQ themed additions, like paintings, changes to mobs, and (what we found the most fun) beds.

## PrideGUI

[PrideGUI](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pridegui) is an addon to the previous Pridepack that slightly overhauls the GUI of the game. It's pretty flashy.

## Blåhaj

[Blåhaj](https://modrinth.com/mod/blahaj) is a mod that adds many variants of our beloved Blåhaj to the game :3

## All-Inclusive Hay Bales

<small>Created by [Dented Modding](https://modrinth.com/organization/dented-modding)</small>

[All-Inclusive Hay Bales](https://modrinth.com/mod/all-inclusive-hay-bales) is real simple: it adds hay bales, with pride! There are over 16 color combinations matching a ton of flags – and documentation for all of it can be viewed with their other mod, [Treatise](https://modrinth.com/mod/treatise).

## Amethyst

[Amethyst](https://github.com/AngelAuraMC) is the successor to the recently archived [Pojav Launcher](https://pojavlauncher.app/), bringing Java Edition to mobile with a nice FOSS launcher! A stable release should be available soon, so stay updated with development by checking out their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/5ptqkyZxEy).

### Happy pride! And see you next week
