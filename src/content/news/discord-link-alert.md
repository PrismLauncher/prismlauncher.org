title: "[PSA] Fake Discord server using our old vanity link"

The invite link discord.gg/prismlauncher is no longer controlled by us, please make sure to use the link on our website and launcher instead (https://prismlauncher.org/discord). And never trust servers which require you to "link"/verify your Minecraft account to join!

With enough [server boosts](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-FAQ) (which require a subscription fee), Discord allows you to set a custom invite link for your server. Unfortunately, if you loose these boosts (which we have) anyone else can claim it.

Currently it is being used to steal Minecraft accounts, but there's no saying what it could be in the future. We rely on members of the community to boost the server and have lost it several times before - even though it was never previously taken over by another server it was frequently inaccessible.

If you see any website, CurseForge/Modrinth page, wiki, Discord server or anything else using our old link make sure to let them know or fix it yourself. Unfortunately, some of our resources contained this link and a user did report having their Minecraft account stolen from this (thank you for informing us of this!).
