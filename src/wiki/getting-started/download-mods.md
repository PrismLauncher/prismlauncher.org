# Downloading Mods

Make sure you know how to [Create an Instance](../create-instance) before attempting to download mods.

Inside the **Edit** menu, select the **Version** tab on the left sidebar. From here, you will need to decide on which mod loader you would like to use. **Fabric** is available for all versions starting with **1.14**. If you are using Forge mods, for Minecraft versions **1.20.1** and below, select **Forge**; for versions above **1.20.1**, it's generally recommended to use **NeoForge** instead. Content-heavy mods are typically made for **Forge** or **NeoForge**, while **Fabric** mods focus more on performance and QOL features.

Once you have picked out your ideal mod loader, go to the **Mods** tab, and select the **Download Mods** option that's to the right. From here, you can choose to install from both *Modrinth* and *CurseForge* services. Modrinth focuses more towards free and open-source mods and is generally recommended, however, some older mods may only exist on CurseForge.

It is worth noting that many mods will be available on **both platforms**.

After you've chosen your mod provider, you can search or browse for any desired mods. Click the **Select mod for download** button to add each mod to your download queue. Once finished, you can now press **OK**, and your mods should begin downloading.

If you have elected to use the **Fabric** mod loader, then please ensure that the latest version of the **Fabric API** mod available for your game version is installed. It is mostly **required** for Fabric mods.

If it is missing, you can install it from **Edit** > **Mods** > **Download mods** like any other mod.
