:::note[Why bother?]
For older Minecraft versions, OptiFine was _the_ way to make your game better, faster, and stronger through various useful features and optimizations. However, since Minecraft 1.16 there exist much better alternatives.
:::

## Detailed explanation

For a very long time, OptiFine was an essential mod that many enjoyed using as it offers important benefits such as performance improvements, extra quality of life features, and more. However, it also has its downsides:

- OptiFine is closed-source. This means that no one can easily inspect its code, and it is much more difficult for developers to make their mods compatible with OptiFine - since they can't see what could be conflicting between their mod and OptiFine.

- OptiFine sometimes takes a long time to update to newer Minecraft versions as there is only one developer working on the mod.

- OptiFine functions as an "all-in-one" mod (similar to a modpack). This makes it impossible for the user to disable/fully remove features that may be incompatible with other mods or that they don't need.

In the past few years, various mods have been made to replace these features and offer a better experience for both mod developers _and_ users. Most of them are open-source, updated faster due to community contributions and support, and allow you to remove features if they're incompatible with another mod or don't suit your preference. These will usually be available on Fabric and Quilt, with some of them natively supporting (or working through compatibility layers) Forge and/or NeoForge.

Most Fabric mods require the <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api">Fabric API</a> mod in order to work, while most Quilt mods require <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl">Quilted Fabric API</a> to work.

If you would like to go a bit further, LambdAurora maintains a [very detailed list of OptiFine alternatives for Fabric and Quilt](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/). There's also [a list of mods used by the Additive modpack](https://github.com/skywardmc/additive/wiki/Give-up-OptiFine), which provides the Minecraft versions that each mod supports along with some extra information.

### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skywardmc/art/main/additive/logo_512h.png" alt="Additive Logo" style="height: 1em; display: inline"> Additive

[Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) is a modpack similar to Fabulously Optimized which aims to support nearly all OptiFine features. It's based on Adrenaline for better performance, supports Fabric, and can be installed on a wide range of Minecraft versions.

### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skywardmc/art/main/adrenaline/logo_512h.png" alt="Adrenaline Logo" style="height: 1em; display: inline"> Adrenaline

[Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline) is a Fabric modpack which aims to improve performance as much as possible while not changing anything about the vanilla game and not introducing instability. Like Simply Optimized, it does not come with any OptiFine replacement mods, so you'll have to manually install the features that you want.

### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92206402?s=200&v=4" alt="Fabulously Optimized Logo" style="height: 1em; display: inline"> Fabulously Optimized

If you don't want to search and install these mods manually, then try the [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) modpack, which supports almost all OptiFine features.

[See the installation instructions](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#prism-launcher) for Prism Launcher.

### <img src="https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BYfVnHa7/icon.png" alt="Simply Optimized Logo" style="height: 1em; display: inline"> Simply Optimized

[Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop) is a modpack designed with just optimization in mind. SO has better out-of-the-box performance than Fabulously Optimized, but it doesn't come with the QoL mods or full OptiFine parity you would see in Fabulously Optimized, so you're expected to add any additional mods you want yourself.

:::caution[Potential issues]
On older Minecraft versions with Forge, you'll need to use unofficial ports of most OptiFine alternatives, which in some rare cases have some compatibility/stability issues.

While on most modpacks/with most mods they're going to work well, a few times they may not.

You can use [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) to run many Fabric mods on Forge.

**Don't report issues with those on upstream's Discord support channels!**
