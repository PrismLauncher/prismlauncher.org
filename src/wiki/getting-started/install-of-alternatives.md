# Why bother?

Once upon a time, OptiFine was *the* way, to make your game better, faster, and stronger. Things have since changed.

**NOTE:** Most Fabric mods require the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) mod in order to work, while most Quilt mods require [Quilted Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) to work.

### <img src="https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/icon.png" height="20"> Sodium

[Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) is the best client-side optimisation mod available at the moment, and we **highly recommend** installing it when possible.

To install in Prism Launcher, create an instance with the **Fabric (or Quilt)** loader, and then go to the *Mods tab* and click **Download Mods**. There, click on *Sodium*, click **Select mod for download**, and then press **OK**.

### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IrisShaders/Iris/trunk/src/main/resources/assets/iris/iris-logo.png" height="20"> Iris

[Iris](https://irisshaders.net/) allows you to use OptiFine shaderpacks, while also running Sodium. It works well, but doesn't yet support every shader.

You can find a list of currently supported shaderpacks [here](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/blob/trunk/docs/supportedshaders.md).

To install in Prism Launcher, create an instance with the **Fabric (or Quilt)** loader, and then go to the *Mods tab* and click **Download Mods**. There, click on *Iris*, click **Select mod for download**, and then press **OK**.

### <img src="https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png" height="20"> Indium

[Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) is an addon for Sodium that provides support for the Fabric Rendering API. This is needed if you want to use Sodium with mods that use advanced rendering techniques.

To install in Prism Launcher, create an instance with the **Fabric (or Quilt)** loader, and then go to the *Mods tab* and click **Download Mods**. There, click on *Indium*, click **Select mod for download**, and then press **OK**.

If you want to further improve your performance, please also consider installing [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight)!

If you would like to go a bit further, LambdAurora maintains a very detailed list of OptiFine alternatives for Fabric and Quilt, which you can find [here](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/).

If you don't want to search and install these mods manually, then try the [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) modpack, which supports almost all OptiFine features.

[See the installation instructions](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#prism-launcher) for Prism Launcher.

[Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop) is a modpack designed with just optimization in mind. SO has better out-of-the-box performance than Fabulously Optimized, but it doesn't come with the QoL mods or full OptiFine parity you would see in Fabulously Optimized, so you're expected to add any additional mods you want yourself.

### Note about Forge

Unlike on Fabric/Quilt, most unofficial ports of OptiFine alternatives for Forge might have some compatibility/stability issues.

While on some modpacks/with some mods they're going to work good, with others they might be *very* unstable so be well aware of what you're doing. If you have issues, use OptiFine.

**Don't report issues with those on upstream's Discord support channels!**
