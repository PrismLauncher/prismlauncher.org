We've created a [Patreon account](http://www.patreon.com/multimc) as a way to support MultiMC and its development team!

Patreon is a fundraising service, designed to let fans of something contribute to the people who make it. You can pledge any monthly amount you want, for perks (such as having your name in the MultiMC credits section) and to support us and the project.

If we get to $100 a month we'll make this website totally advert free. Adverts suck but servers are expensive, and as such adverts have been a necessary evil (until now, with Patreon).

One thing we don't want to do is promise features as milestone goals. Good ideas and features shouldn't be blocked until we reach monetary goals, they should be implemented on their own merit.

Thanks for all your support, hopefully we can kill adverts on the website soon!
