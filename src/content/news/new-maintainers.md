Based off recent controversies, and for the project's best interest, Swirl has stepped down from his role as maintainer. LennyMcLennington is now the head maintainer of PolyMC and has established a new core group of maintainers to keep the project healthy and active.

**Swirl Stated**:

> @here Based on recent controversies, and in thinking of the general future of this project, I believe it to be best if I step down from my leadership position in PolyMC.
>
> Lenny will now be maintaining PolyMC and all its related services, and will be establishing a core team to help with development resources and community management.
>
> Additionally, due to mental health and other personal reasons, I will be taking a break from--and generally will be unavailable for--contributing to the project.
>
> Thank you all for providing me a great community to work with. I pray for PolyMC to have a good future and for all of you to continue to do good for the Free Software community.
