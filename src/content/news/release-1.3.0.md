Hey!
It's update-time again. This time we bring you some highlights, like Modrinth modpack support, a Windows installer, more paste services and improvements around our ATLauncher support.
There is also a breaking change affecting older platforms.
We have bumped our Qt dependency requirement to version 5.12.
If you user an older platform, you might still be able to run PolyMC through our existing distribution methods (AppImage, Flatpak on Linux).

Initially this release should have included a workaround for download issues with CurseForge mods and modpacks, but we were contacted by CurseForge to remove our workaround.
