# Making use of Controllers

This includes Steam Deck's Gamepad, PlayStation/Xbox controllers and so on.

## Before proceeding

* Please ensure that you are comfortable with the mod installation process within Prism Launcher.
* A full guide on this can be [found here](../download-mods/).
* Not all game versions are supported at the time of writing, including those before 1.12.2.
* Please ensure a compatible version of Java is selected. [You can learn how to do so here](../installing-java/).

Finally, if you don't have one already, you must create an **instance** with the game version and mod loader of your choice.

Before you continue, ensure that the correct version of the **Fabric API** mod on **Fabric** or the **Quilted Fabric API** mod on **Quilt** for your instance is installed.

For Minecraft 1.19.4 or newer, we recommend [**Controlify**](https://modrinth.com/mod/controlify). It's a controller mod that has [a lot of features that aren't in MidnightControls](https://moddedmc.wiki/en/project/controlify/latest/docs/users/mod-comparison).

It can be installed using Prism Launcher's mod downloader function through either Modrinth (recommended) or CurseForge. Once installed, please launch your instance and navigate to the in-game controller menu (Options -> Controls -> Controller Settings) and do the calibration. Once that's done, you're ready to use your controller!

For Minecraft 1.18 or newer, we recommend [**MidnightControls**](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightcontrols), an updated fork of LambdaControls.

It can be installed using Prism Launcher's mod downloader function through either Modrinth (recommended) or CurseForge. Once installed, please launch your instance and navigate to the in-game controls menu. Within the in-game controls menu, you may need to change the "Mode" setting to **Controller** in order for the game to respond to input from the gamepad. If it doesn't work, you can use [**the app linked in the mod**](https://generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/) to edit the controller mappings.
