Just a short post, but I ([Devin](https://github.com/intergrav)) have spent a few weeks redesigning the entire Prism website. I focused on making the site look better, more consistent, and easier to use. We are also moving the wiki to a Starlight-based wiki so that should also be easier for us to maintain and easier for you to navigate.

Have a good day :)
