It's the [last week](/news/pride-showcase-2025-3/) of our Pride showcase! Thanks to all of those who sent in submissions: they were a blast to look through, test out in our games, and learn some of the stories behind how these projects came to be. We're proud to highlight the level of creativity that comes out of our Queer community every day, and hope everyone has as much fun discovering and playing with these creations as we did.

To celebrate, we have also compiled all the in-game content we could into a Modrinth Collection that you can use at home. You can find it [here](https://modrinth.com/collection/BJ6shJXL)! (batteries are not included)

[Snapper](https://modrinth.com/mod/snapper) is a simple, but feature-packed screenshot mod. It adds the ability to view and manage screenshots in-game, take panoramic screenshots (similar to those you see on the main menu), and get quick access to your recent screenshots through dedicated keybinds.

## Xenia Foxpack

The Xenia "Foxpack" is a [CatPack](/wiki/getting-started/catpacks/) featuring Xenia, [an alternative Linux mascot to Tux](https://xenia.efi.pages.gay/). It comes in two variants:

[Allium](https://github.com/HyacinthBots/Allium) is a Discord ~~bot~~ app centered around Minecraft modding. It features [countless](https://github.com/HyacinthBots/Allium/blob/root/docs/commands.md) commands, with some letting you query multiple different game mappings (i.e., Mojang's, Yarn, Quilt), convert between them, and even search for projects on providers like Curseforge and Modrinth.

## Everybody Loves: Hives

[Everybody Loves: Hives](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/everybody-loves-hives) is a resource pack that turns the hives gay! It's the perfect companion to [Everybody Loves: Bees](/news/pride-showcase-2025-3/#everybody-loves:-bees) — a pack featured [last week](/news/pride-showcase-2025-3/) — and even has support for other bee-related expansion mods like [Forestry: Community Edition](https://modrinth.com/mod/forestry-community-edition).

## And a reminder...

You **matter**, you are **valid**, and you are **loved**. [Help is out there if you need it](https://glaad.org/resourcelist).

### Happy pride, all year!
