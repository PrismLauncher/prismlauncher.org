# Why bother?

Once upon a time, OptiFine was *the* way, to make your game better, faster, and stronger. Things have since changed.

**NOTE:** Most Fabric mods require the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) mod in order to work, while most Quilt mods require [Quilted Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) to work.

### <img src="https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/icon.png" height="20"> Sodium

[Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) is the best client-side optimisation mod available at the moment, and we **highly recommend** installing it when possible.

To install in PolyMC, create an instance with the **Fabric (or Quilt)** loader, and then go to the *Mods tab* and click **Download Mods**. There, click on *Sodium*, click **Select mod for download**, and then press **OK**.

### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IrisShaders/Iris/trunk/src/main/resources/assets/iris/iris-logo.png" height="20"> Iris

[Iris](https://irisshaders.net/) allows you to use OptiFine shaderpacks, while also running Sodium. It works well, but doesn't yet support every shader.

You can find a list of currently supported shaderpacks [here](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/blob/trunk/docs/supportedshaders.md).

To install in PolyMC, create an instance with the **Fabric (or Quilt)** loader, and then go to the *Mods tab* and click **Download Mods**. There, click on *Iris*, click **Select mod for download**, and then press **OK**.

If you want to further improve your performance, please also consider installing [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight)!

If you would like to go a bit further, LambdAurora maintains a very detailed list of OptiFine alternatives for Fabric and Quilt, which you can find [here](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/).

If you don't want to search, and install these mods manually, then try the [Fabulously Optimized](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized) modpack.

See the [MultiMC/MultiMC (auto-update)](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions#multimc) guide for help installing it. These instructions will work for PolyMC too.

### Note about Forge

Unlike on Fabric/Quilt, most unofficial ports of OptiFine alternatives for Forge might have some compatibility/stability issues.

While on some modpacks/with some mods they're going to work good, with others they might be *very* unstable so be well aware of what you're doing. If you have issues, use OptiFine.

**Don't report issues with those on upstream's Discord support channels!**
