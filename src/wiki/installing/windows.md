## Installing PolyMC's Official Portable Archive

While installing this version of PolyMC on **Windows** should be relatively simple, you will need to know how to extract a **.Zip** archive file.

To begin, navigate to our downloads page and choose the "Download (Portable)" under the **Windows** heading.

Your browser should ask you if you would prefer to save or open the archive. Please choose a location on your system where you'd like the downloaded file to go, and then select the **save** option.

Once the download has completed, navigate to the location of the downloaded file, **right click** on it, and choose the "**Extract All...**" option.

Once the extraction operation has completed, PolyMC should launch after you **double click** on the file named **polymc.exe**.

### Creating a Shortcut

If you wish to have a shortcut to PolyMC for use on your desktop for example, you can create one by **right clicking** on **polymc.exe**, and choosing the **Create Shortcut** option within the context menu.

You may now **move** or **copy** the created shortcut to any desired location on your system.

### A Note on Legacy Windows Support (Windows 7/8/8.1)

While it may be **possible** to install PolyMC on these legacy operating systems, it is **not recommended, nor is it officially supported**. We may or may not choose to provide support for any issues you encounter.
