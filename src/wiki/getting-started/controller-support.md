# Making use of Controllers

This includes Steam Deck's Gamepad, PlayStation/Xbox controllers and so on.

## Before proceeding

* Please ensure that you comfortable with the mod installation process within PolyMC.
* A full guide on this can be [found here](../download-mods/).
* Not all game versions are supported at the time of writing, including those before 1.12.2.
* Before proceeding, please ensure a compatable version of Java is selected. [You can learn how to do so here](../installing-java/).

Finally, if you don't have one already, you must create an **instance** with the game version and mod loader of your choice.

Before you continue, ensure that the correct version of the **Fabric API** mod on **Fabric** or the **Quilted Fabric API** mod on **Quilt** for your instance is installed.

For Minecraft 1.16.5 to 1.17.1 we recommend the **LambdaControls** mod.

It can be be installed using PolyMC's mod downloader function either with Modrinth (recommended) or CurseForge.

Once installed, please launch your instance and navigate to the in-game controls menu.

Within the in-game controls menu, you may need to change the "Mode" setting to **Controller**, in order for the game to respond to input from the gamepad.

Remember to get the mapping using [**the app linked in the mod**](https://generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/)

### <img src="https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com//data/bXX9h73M/icon.svg" height="20">  MidnightControls (for Minecraft Versions 1.18 - 1.19)

Since LambdaControls got deprecated, someone decided to fork it and update it.

In fact, here we're recommending [MidnightControls](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightcontrols).

It's an updated fork of LambdaControls.

It can be be installed using PolyMC's mod downloader function either with Modrinth (recommended) or CurseForge.

Once installed, please launch your instance and navigate to the in-game controls menu.

Within the in-game controls menu, you may need to change the "Mode" setting to **Controller**, in order for the game to respond to input from the gamepad.

If it doesn't work, try to get the mapping using [**the app linked in the mod**](https://generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/)

For Minecraft 1.12.2 to 1.19 on Forge we recommend the **Controllable** mod.

Controllable can be be installed using PolyMC's mod downloader function from the **CurseForge** service.

Once installed, you may now launch your instance, and find that the mod should begin working immediately.
