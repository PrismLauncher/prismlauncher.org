It's been a while since the last update. Today is our second birthday and we are happy to celebrate it with you by releasing Prism Launcher 9.0, packed with features we've been working hard on! We hope you'll love playing around with these much-anticipated additions:

- Automatic Java Management – No more manual Java setups! Everything is streamlined and handled for you.
- Automatic Component Version Resolution – Managing component versions just got easier, with automatic updates for things like Fabric mappings.
- Skin Management – A simple and intuitive way to manage your Minecraft skins right in the launcher.
- Updated Login System – Introduced direct login and QR code for a smoother experience.
- More Filters in the Download Mods/Modpacks Dialog – Find your favorite mods/modpack faster with new filtering options.

There's plenty more to explore, so feel free to dive in and check the changelog for the full list of updates!

As always, your feedback is invaluable. Let us know how it goes, and if you'd like to contribute to the project, head over to our GitHub and see how you can get involved.
